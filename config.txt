# Amit's Key-group Builder v 1.0 scripts ###############
# please note lines started by # are comments
# WARNING: Each Key-group File (.xpm is about 905 KB (1MB)) so use judiciously.

# Command Format
#  MODE Path
#path is full path containing the wav files to create key-groups from
#Modes are as listed below
# SCW : The Provided Folders Contains Single Cycle waveforms and a Key-group file will be created for each wave file and Root Note will be determined from the number of samples contained and will loop.
# MULTI : The Path Folder will be considered as containing multi-samples for a single Patch, The Wave filenames must end with Either Exact Note Number (00-96) or NoteName (C0, E5, C6 , B-2 etc) 
#         Example file names required for multi mode : myflute 36.wav, myflute C3.wav, or myflute-36.wav, myflute-C3.wav (both spaces and hyphens allowed, use either one).
#         if you need your sample to loop, do so in an audio editor that lets you define loop points or do it one by one in force or MPC App.
#         The Key-group will Take the Name of the Folder.
# SINGLES : Each Wav file in the path Folder will be considered a separate sample and a key-group will be created for each, mapping it across the keyboard
#           if the wave file ends with Note Number or Note name, that will be used as the root of the sample. for example myFlute 00.wav or myFlute-E3.wav
#           The Name of the Key-group will be same as the wave file.
#
# if you add a * in end of path, then all sub-folders under the path will be processed, for converting large collections.
# Example Commands 
# SCW /volumes/myfolder/singlecycleswavs  (mac/linux style)
# MULTI d:\mywavs\multisamples\myflute
# SINGLES  d:\mywavs\samplestoconvert
# SCW /volumes/myfolder/singlecycleswavs*
# MULTI /volumes/myfolder/multisamples*       (All sub-folders will be converted each into a  separate key-group from samples contained in the sub folder)
#The Options line below is used to specifiy some global options (separated by space as follows) 
#   SCW_WRITE_SMPL_CHUNK : will generate a SMPL meta info and Akai atemp meta chunk and will add it to SCW wav file. SMPL chunk contains Pitch as well as sample loop point.

#OPTIONS SCW_WRITE_SMPL_CHUNK

#enter the conversion commands below this line (each line for a different folder and command)
