# Amit's Key-group Builder scripts ###############
# please note lines starting by # are comments except the # OPTIONS line which is used to set OPTIONS.
# WARNING: Each Key-group File (.xpm is about 905 KB (1MB)) so use judiciously.

# Command Format
#  MODE Path
#path is full path containing the wav files to create key-groups from
#Modes are as listed below
# SCW : The Provided Folders Contains Single Cycle waveforms and a Key-group file will be created for each wave file and Root Note will be determined from the number of samples contained and will loop.
# MULTI : The Path Folder will be considered as containing multi-samples for a single Patch, The Wave filenames must end with Either Exact Note Number (00-96) or NoteName (C0, E5, C6 , B-2 etc) 
#         Example file names required for multi mode : myflute 36.wav, myflute C3.wav, or myflute-36.wav, myflute-C3.wav (both spaces and hyphens allowed, use either one).
#         if you need your sample to loop, do so in an audio editor that lets you define loop points or do it one by one in force or MPC App.
#         The Key-group will Take the Name of the Folder.
# SINGLES : Each Wav file in the path Folder will be considered a separate sample and a key-group will be created for each, mapping it across the keyboard
#           if the wave file ends with Note Number or Note name, that will be used as the root of the sample. for example myFlute 00.wav or myFlute-E3.wav
#           The Name of the Key-group will be same as the wave file.
#
# if you add a * in end of path, then all sub-folders under the path will be processed, for converting large collections.
# Example Commands 
# SCW /volumes/myfolder/singlecycleswavs  (mac/linux style)
# MULTI d:\mywavs\multisamples\myflute
# SINGLES  d:\mywavs\samplestoconvert
# SCW /volumes/myfolder/singlecycleswavs*
# MULTI /volumes/myfolder/multisamples*       (All sub-folders will be converted each into a  separate key-group from samples contained in the sub folder)
#The Options line below is used to specifiy some global options (separated by space as follows) 
#   SCW_WRITE_SMPL_CHUNK : will generate a SMPL meta info and Akai atemp meta chunk and will add it to SCW wav file. SMPL chunk contains Pitch as well as sample loop point.
#   PREFER_WAV_EMBEDDED_ROOT : Will ignore the note number specified in file name and use the value embedded in the wav file smpl chunk (useful when samples are coming from another sampler or soundfont) Does not Apply to SCW.
